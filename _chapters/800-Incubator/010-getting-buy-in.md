## Intent

Equitable grading practices require getting buy-in from stakeholders such as administrators and students.

## Problem

Equitable grading practices are often unfamiliar to students and administrators, which may interfere with deeply-held beliefs and values around traditional approaches to grading. Changing mindsets about grading is crucial toward successful implementation of equitable grading practices.

## Solution

Utilize student-centered discussions that enable students to come to their own conclusions about their prior experiences with grades and learning. Emphasize student proficiency and learning over grades as the goal of the course. Be transparent about potential discomfort that students may initially face.

## Applicability

This play is broadly applicable. Regardless of the educational context, students can benefit from knowing not only how grades will be determined at the end of the term, but also why the instructor chose their approach to grading. This is particularly important in educational contexts where students are more familiar with certain types of traditional grading (that do not emphasize, for instance, opportunities to demonstrate learning over time), which are common especially in higher education today.

## How to Implement

One way to get buy-in from students is by organizing class reflection activities. For example, during class, an instructor can lead a word association activity whereby students relate the words "grade" and "learning" to issues that the instructor identified as key motivations for adopting equitable grading practices. Through this reflection, students may start to realize that grades do not often have a positive influence on learning. The instructor can also reaffirm to students that their equitable grading practice will be uncomfortable at first but note that, by the end of the quarter, students often become comfortable with grading practices and gain a deeper appreciation for learning in the course.
