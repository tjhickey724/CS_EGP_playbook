## Intent

Utilize aspects of specifications grading and grading for equity to increase learner's motivation to learn.  

## Problem

Traditional points-based grading systems have been found to have a variety of concerns including the effectiveness, 
reliability, accuracy, and necessity of grading. 
In addition, intrinsic motivation has been found to be negatively impacted by points-based grading systems.
Learner's focus on grades for extrinsic motivation has been found to result in increases in learner anxiety and 
their motivation to cheat.

## Solution

This play combines aspects of specifications grading and grading for equity to achieve the goals of 
+ allowing for re-submission of assignments
+ retaking of examinations
+ reducing numeric grades, in favor of complete/incomplete

## Applicability

This play was implemented in three sections of an upper level undergraduate computer science elective course
(database systems). 
The three sections had a total of 67 learners.

There can be a significant burden to develop alternative versions of exams to allow for retakes. 
Also, extra time is needed to proctor examination retakes and evaluate regrade requests.

This play has not been implemented in other settings to know if the level or
enrollment of the course could impact its effectiveness.

## How to Implement

1.  **Assessment:** Manually assessed assignments are identified as complete or incomplete,
and included detailed feedback to allow the learner to improve. 
When automated assessment tools generate a numeric grade,
a numerical threshold of 85% was used to determine complete/incomplete.

2. **Regrade requests:** Although it may be philosophically desirable to allow unlimited regrades,
concerns about the number and quality of regrades can arise.
To reduce these concerns, establish category limits for each grade level.
For example, learners can submit a regrade request for up to 5 labs and/or reading activities while still 
meeting the A level.

The following table provides an example of how the course grade was determined.

| Assignment (qty) | Goal             |                    A                    |                    B                     |                     C                     |
|---------------|------------------|:---------------------------------------:|:----------------------------------------:|:-----------------------------------------:|
| Readings (15)<br/><br/>Labs (23)<br/><br/>Regrades | Complete (> 85%)<br/><br/>Complete (> 85%)<br/><br/>Use no more than | All but 2<br/><br/>All but 2<br/><br/>5 | All but 3<br/><br/>All but 4<br/><br/>6  | All but 4<br/> <br/>All but 6<br/><br/>7  | 
|Exams (4)<br/><br/>Exam Retakes | Complete (> 85%)<br/><br/>Use no more than |             All<br/><br/>2              |           All but 1<br/><br/>3           |           All but 2<br/><br/>4            |
|Final Exam | Score at least |                 >= 90%                  |                  >= 80%                  |                  >= 70%                   |
