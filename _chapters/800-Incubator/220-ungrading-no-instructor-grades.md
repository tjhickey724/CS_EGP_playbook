## Intent

The goal of this practice is to foster a supportive and motivating learning environment by replacing traditional grading with constructive feedback, aiming to reduce stress and increase intrinsic motivation among students.


## Problem

Traditional grading systems often fail to measure learning effectively and may induce stress and demotivation. Grades can distract students from meaningful engagement in learning by focusing on outcomes rather than the learning process. Additionally, grading can inadvertently label students, reinforcing a product-focused rather than person-centered approach.


## Solution

The grade is no longer set by the instructor, but (if required by the institution) by the student, and/or by peer assessment.

Several components were highlighted as characteristics of Ungrading:
* Feedback is always available with plentiful opportunities to resubmit work
* Learning is self-paced – students determine the curriculum and speed through it
* Learning is continuous (vs stopping when the student reaches a goal, here there's no limit) until there's a "satisfactory conclusion for both parties"
* Learning doesn't happen in isolation, but in a supportive learning community

## Applicability

Ungrading is especially suitable in environments where developing a growth mindset is a priority, and where fostering intrinsic motivation aligns with educational goals. It works well in supportive settings with smaller classes, where teachers can invest time in feedback. However, it may be challenging in large, assessment-driven courses or institutions that mandate strict grading policies. Subjects requiring standardized outcomes, like certification programs, may find Ungrading less applicable without adjustments.

## How to Implement

Implementing Ungrading requires preparation and clear communication with students, and buy-in from the institution. Begin by explaining the concept and its benefits to ease any uncertainties. Encourage students to engage with feedback as a tool for improvement. Create opportunities for peer and self-assessment and consider small Ungrading trials in specific assignments or units before scaling. Ensure regular feedback cycles and provide structured rubrics focused on learning goals to guide the Ungrading process effectively.
